# torrent-share
A peer to peer network for transmitting data

# Ideas !
1. Resources to be shared on the P2P network - pdf files, images, videos, audio, text or any document file, code files.
2. Implementing and code various torrent algorithms instead of using any existing library ( avoid using them as much as possible ) 
3. Ability to share files to any of the connected machine and displaying the entire details of the file, its sender, the time, the sequence etc.
4. Adding security features to torrent
